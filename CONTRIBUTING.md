# CONTRIBUTING.md

You can raise a PR or an issue for any bugs, new features, feature requests and similar.

For any PRs the tests are expected to pass, and for any changes or additions to functionality
those need to be covered by changes or additions to the test coverage.

I might miss the GitHub notifications for a new PR/issue created, feel free to email me at
m.tusnio@gmail.com if things are taking too long or even straight after opening a PR or
an issue.
